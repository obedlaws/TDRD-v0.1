## Hey! I did this! @obedlaws
I started this project to be part of my portfolio and
also to pass finish my course at Codeacademy's CS Learning Path.

Hope you like it. This is my first small project and im looking to make
a better version with python and django and adding a little more features in the future!

ENJOY!
